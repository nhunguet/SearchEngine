2/ Handling dynamic web pages with JavaScript a lot of techniques that can deal with the additional layer of complexity introduced by JavaScript rendering:

Headless Browsers: Use tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, or Playwright to render JavaScript-heavy pages. Ideal for full interactivity but resource-intensive.

Request-HTML: A lightweight option to fetch and render JavaScript using Python. Best for moderate use cases.

API Scraping: Check browser developer tools for APIs used by the website and scrape directly from those endpoints. Fast and efficient if available.

Pre-rendering Services: Use tools like Scrapy-Splash, Rendertron, or Browserless.io to fetch fully-rendered HTML.

Playwright: A modern and efficient alternative to Selenium for complex, dynamic interactions.

Recommendation:
For simple tasks, try requests-html or API scraping.
For complex JavaScript rendering, use Selenium, Playwright, or Puppeteer.
For large-scale scraping, integrate tools like Scrapy-Splash.

3/ To handle CAPTCHA in web scraping:

Avoid Triggering CAPTCHAs: Use realistic browsing patterns, rotate IPs, and set appropriate headers (e.g., User-Agent, cookies).

Use CAPTCHA-Solving Services: Rely on third-party services like 2Captcha, Anti-Captcha, or DeathByCaptcha to solve CAPTCHAs programmatically.

Leverage Pre-Logged Cookies: Solve CAPTCHA manually in a browser, extract session cookies, and use them in your requests.

Human Interaction: For complex CAPTCHAs, use a headless browser (e.g., Selenium) to display the CAPTCHA for manual resolution.

Bypass Invisible CAPTCHAs: Mimic human behavior (e.g., mouse movements, realistic delays) to bypass reCAPTCHA v3 when possible.

Note: Always respect ethical guidelines and terms of service when dealing with CAPTCHAs.
